## idea
​
- since c++ sucks % with neg numbers
- so use ```req = (sum-rr+p) ```
​
### concept
​
- While division we gget 6n+k form
- let k is the rem why its not divisible
- then we need sum of a subbarr with rem == k
- so we iterate on the modded prefix sum,
- if ps == z
- we want now z-rr to be the other half,
- in modular arithmetic it is (same as sum-rr+p)
​
So so, and find the smallest
